My creation of this project was a spontaneous collaboration of image and audio assets, while trying to imitate stop-motion an animation with p5 and JavaScript by implementinguser-clickable frames. I retrieved my audio assets from YouTube and created all the image pixel art assets (chatacter frames and musical notes and clef) from scratch using 'Pixilart'. 
My idea of the quick project was to display a loop of the character in their sleep cycle, going between a sleep state and a dream state, where they are listening to music.
