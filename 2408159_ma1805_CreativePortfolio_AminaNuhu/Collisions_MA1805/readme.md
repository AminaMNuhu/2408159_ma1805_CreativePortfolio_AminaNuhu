this project for collisions displays the collision interaction between the square and the circle on a black canvas. The movement of the circle is controlled by the mouse/user, while the square remains at a fixed/static position.
With the aid of p5.js references and inspiration for some p5.js examples I combined the shape collision element with additional mouse clicked and arrow pressed events. this includes features to chnage the colour of the square by clicking on it during a collision and changing the size and colour of the circle by clicking on it and using the up and down arrows.
