The general theme of this drawing project is 'traffic and motorway'. It contains a 2D vertical mortorway road with white lane lines, an also 2D red stop sign, and a traffic light with 3D rotating lights, all on a sky blue background.

My creation process of this project's drawings and its theme was completely spontaneous.
